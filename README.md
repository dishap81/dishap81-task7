📌 Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Objective

The objective of this task is to understand and implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification.
We use the Breast Cancer dataset to classify tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B).


---

Steps in the Code

1. Load Dataset

Breast Cancer dataset is loaded.

Dropped id column (not useful).

Encoded target (diagnosis) as 0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant.



2. Data Preprocessing

Splitting into train and test sets (80:20).

Scaling features using StandardScaler for better SVM performance.



3. Model Training

Linear SVM trained on scaled data.

RBF Kernel SVM trained to capture non-linear boundaries.



4. Evaluation

Accuracy calculated for both Linear and RBF models.

Cross-validation used for reliable accuracy estimation.



5. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)

Best values of C and gamma are found using GridSearchCV.

Best cross-validation accuracy reported.



6. Visualization

PCA (2D projection) applied for visualization.

Decision boundary plotted with data points.





---

Output

1. Linear SVM Accuracy: Example → 0.96


2. RBF Kernel SVM Accuracy: Example → 0.97


3. Best Parameters (from GridSearchCV): {'C': 10, 'gamma': 0.01, 'kernel': 'rbf'}


4. Best Cross-validation Accuracy: Example → 0.98


5. Graph:

2D scatter plot of data points (Malignant vs. Benign).

Decision boundary shaded (linear = straight, RBF = curved).

Learning Outcomes

Understood margin maximization in SVM.

Observed how kernel trick (RBF) handles non-linear data.

Learned hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma) improves model performance.

Visualized classification boundary using PCA for high-dimensional data.

👉 This completes Task 7 (SVM) successfully.
